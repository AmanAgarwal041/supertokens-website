# SuperTokens

## About
This is a library written in TypeScript that implements the frontend part of user session management for websites.

## Installation
```bash
npm i --save auth-website
```

## Usage


## Example code & Demo
You can play around with the demo project that uses this and the [auth-node-mysql-ref-jwt](https://github.com/supertokens/auth-node-mysql-ref-jwt) library. The demo demonstrats how this package behaves when it detects auth token theft (and the best part is that you are the attacker, muahahaha)!

## Making changes
This library is written in TypeScript (TS). When you make any changes to the .ts files in the root folder, run the following command to compile to .js:
```bash
tsc -p tsconfig.json
```
